The TODO Group is pleased to announce the [results of the 2025 Steering Committee election](https://todogroup.org/blog/sc-elections-2026/), selecting members who will serve from **2026 to 2028**. Please join us in welcoming the new members who will join the Steering Committee on January 1, 2026.

### Ashley Wolf (Director of GitHub’s Open Source Programs Office)  

Over the past year, Ashley has seen how the group’s guides, the OSPO Book, AMAs, and community calls help organizations at very different stages of maturity learn from each other and avoid reinventing the wheel. For her, TODO is where OSPO leaders can turn shared challenges into shared solutions. Looking ahead, Ashley aims to build on what already works while pushing the community into new territory. She wants to keep strengthening the guides and TODO Ask Me Anything sessions at LF events that are already core to knowledge sharing, and at the same time help the group explore concrete workflows and tools (including AI) that make OSPOs true centers of support for emerging technologies. A key part of her focus is creating more opportunities for newer OSPO leaders to connect with experienced practitioners, so that knowledge transfer happens not only through written resources but also through relationships and mentorship. Her goal is to ensure TODO remains the natural home for OSPO conversations worldwide and a trusted partner for organizations that want to make their open source practice more effective and sustainable.

### Stephen Augustus** (Technical Architect at Bloomberg's CTO Office)  

Looking ahead, Stephen believes there are opportunities to deepen existing partnerships and establish new ones with other open source communities through the group’s collective networks. He aims to further empower current and new ambassadors with greater responsibilities in program ownership, such as mentorship, and to develop a more visible contributor ladder that creates additional pathways to leadership—helping build a stronger pool of future Steering Committee nominees

### Brittany Istenes (Strategist at Fannie Mae's Open Source Program Office)

Brittany will strengthen cross-foundation collaboration, expand education around compliance and InnerSource as stepping stones to open source, and amplify success stories from sectors like FinTech that demonstrate how open source can thrive under tight risk controls. She seeks to maintain TODO’s role as a trusted forum for OSPO leaders while helping to extend its reach into underrepresented industries, ensuring the community remains a place where strategy, culture, and technical excellence come together.

### Fernando Correa (Senior Software Engineer at Mercado Libre's Open Source Program Office)

Fernando has actively participated and collaborated with the TODO Group, having been fortunate to be accepted as an Ambassador and to help spread awareness about OSPOs and the TODO Group across the Latin American region. He sees great value in many of the group’s existing initiatives and working groups and believes he can contribute by promoting more active and consistent participation within the community, working alongside other Ambassadors to support ongoing efforts. Fernando also recognizes that many current Steering Committee members have demanding schedules and that time zone differences can make engagement challenging. He views his participation as an opportunity to help mitigate this issue by contributing regularly and bringing regional diversity and representation from Brazil and the broader LATAM community.
