Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) are becoming increasingly prevalent across various sectors, regions, and organizational sizes. 
In 2020, the TODO Group community released the first version of OSPOdefinition.org, to provide a common lexicon 
for describing open source programs. As the OSPO becomes a more widely recognized term in different sectors, the TODO community recognizes the need to update the traditional 
OSPO definition to reflect current trends and be more inclusive.

## üß© Community Input

Various OSPO practitioners and open source contributors from different foundations and communities provided initial input to define a more accurate 
and inclusive definition to reflect 2023 trends and scope. Through [previous discussions in the OSPO Book Project working group](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/pull/282), 
the open source project received contributions that helped [inform an updated definition to include in the book](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/blob/main/ospo-book/chapters/01-chapter.md#ospo-definition),
and which content is used as the baseline for the Pull Request (PR) that is available in the ospodefinition.org repository. 

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How can I contribute to the OSPO Definition 2023 Release?

Before the final merge and review from our Steering Committee, we welcome open source folks and OSPOers to [contribute to the Pull Request 
(PR) by requesting changes](https://github.com/todogroup/ospodefinition.org/pull/9) throughout the month of May.

Thank you for your support in improving the OSPO definition and making it more inclusive and relevant to today's open source landscape.

The [OSPO Definition](https://github.com/todogroup/ospodefinition.org) is available on GitHub under CC-BY-SA 4.0 and available for anyone to reference.

At the end of the day, each OSPO is custom-configured based on its particular organizational culture and goals.
