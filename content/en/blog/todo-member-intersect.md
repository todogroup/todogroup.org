We are excited to announce that Intersect MBO has joined the Linux Foundation's TODO Group as a General Member!

## Intersect's Open Source Office (OSO)

Intersect MBO established its Open Source Office (OSO) to strategically lead the adoption, contribution, and governance of Open Source Software (OSS) within their organization. Focused on enhancing the impact of OSS across their projects, the Intersect OS(P)O works on:

- **Innovation in OSS Adoption**: Identifying and integrating cutting-edge open source technologies into their offerings.
- **Strategic Governance**: Ensuring OSS policies align with business goals while maintaining community best practices.
- **License Compliance**: Managing adherence to OSS licensing requirements and regulations.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Providing training and resources to empower teams with OSS expertise.
- **Community Engagement**: Actively contributing to and supporting open source communities.

Intersect is a member-based organization for the Cardano ecosystem and its OSPO relies on Coordinating open source development of core technologies for Cardano. Open source is becoming increasingly crucial 
for Cardano as it provides access to faster development and community involvement and allows for more significant innovation through collaboration with the broader ecosystem. However, managing open-source software can be challenging, 
which is where an Open Source Office (OSO) comes in.

## TODO Representatives

Please join us in welcoming the following OS(P)O representatives from Intersect MBO:

## About TODO

The Linux Foundationâ€™s TODO Group supports organizations in establishing and fostering strategic and sustainable open source engagements with open source projects and their community by addressing common challenges and openly sharing best practices for successful and sustainable implementation. 

General Members of the TODO Group are representatives from organizations actively engaged in open source management and strategy. They are responsible for driving open source adoption across divisions and product lines. A proven pattern to enable this adoption and a holistic approach is the establishment 
of Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs). By joining TODO, your organization can also contribute to the growth and continuous update of best practices, ensuring more organizations can successfully engage with open source.
