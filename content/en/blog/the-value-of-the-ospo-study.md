*Why are Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) valuable from a business perspective?* That's the question addressed in the latest report from the TODO Group.
The study explores the different value propositions of OSPOs and shares recommendations and provide insights that helps to to understand, measure, and communicate
their value to stakeholders, regulators, and other staff members within the organization.

It draws on perspectives from OSPO and open source leaders from Europe, Asia, and North America in a variety of industries,
including two public universities.

The report covers several key areas, including the motivations behind establishing OSPOs, the primary challenges faced by OSPOs, the common skills required for OSPOs (the different hats of the OSPO), the top KPIs that OSPOs measure (including sustaining contributors and project success), and the importance of OSPO sustainability and project health.

If you're interested in learning more about the business value of OSPOs, we encourage you to read the full report.
