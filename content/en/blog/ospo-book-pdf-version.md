The TODO Group, in collaboration with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, is thrilled to announce that the **OSPO Book is now available for download as a PDF**, and **will be available in print at OSSummit Europe this August**!

Whether your organization is using, contributing to, or building open source software, this book is designed to help your organization strategically manage open source operations with guidance from OSPO practitioners around the world.

## What’s Inside?

The OSPO Book includes collaboratively developed insights, frameworks, and tools contributed by OSPO professionals across industries. It covers key topics such as:

- **Chapter 1**: Introduction to Open Source Program Offices  
- **Chapter 2**: The Value of Open Source Program Offices  
- **Chapter 3**: Creating Your OSPO  
- **Chapter 4**: Day-to-Day Operations  
- NEW **Chapter 5**: Managing Open Source Security (In collaboration with OpenSSF)
- NEW **Chapter 6**: Using Metrics in your OSPO (In collaboration with CHAOSS)

These two new chapters on **Security** and **Metrics** reflect recent community priorities and were created with the support and expertise of OpenSSF and CHAOSS, respectively.

The release of this edition would not have been possible without the invaluable help of our technical reviewers and contributors. A huge shout-out to our OSPO Book Chairs: Alice Sowerby, Fernando Correa, Zhiquian Yu, Gergely Csatari, Alin Jerpelea, Jan van den Berg, Victor Jun Lu
