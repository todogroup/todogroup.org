## Whom is this group for?

The primary purpose of this group is to bring together organizations who run open
source programs. We believe there are a number of challenges for organizations who
want to run open source projects and programs effectively. We discovered we had
only rarely even shared our own experiences, and formed this group to help
improve shared knowledge about running such programs.

## Should I join?

There are lots of different ways in which open source is built, used, and
released - and there are many foundations, groups, and communities for different
aspects of this rich ecosystem. TODO is specifically intended as a forum for
companies' open source program managers to come together. Members generally tend
to represent organizations who consider open source to be an adjunct their core
business.

## Which organizations are participating?

See the full [list of members](/members). If you would like to take part too,
please [contact us](/join).

## Can I be part of the TODO Community without being an official TODO Member?

Yes, TODO Group resources are essentially like any other open source project.

Everyone willing to contribute to improve OSPO education and adoption across industries worldwide is more than welcome to join the community and take part of the public resources through our GitHub page: https://github.com/todogroup. TODO community members include, but are not restricted to:

* OSPO Managers
* OSPO initiatives
* Industry partners 
* Foundations

In order to keep a secure place to freely share sensitive information, the TODO Group offers TODO Member-only spaces. If you consider you meet [TODO Membership requirements](https://todogroup.org/join/), please complete the [membership application](https://joinnow.todogroup.org/).

## What are the benefits of being a TODO member?

Please take a look to the [TODO Group Overview Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p4dhx0Dg8fZDO8yzp7nWC2r5WHyVH-jjSQM59lkKLdo/edit?usp=sharing) to learn more about membership benefits.

## What deliverables can we expect to see from this group?

Our plans include work such as:

* Sharing best practices for running large open source programs well
* Codifying criteria or qualities that well-run projects should aspire to
* Tooling & instrumentation that makes it easier to reach and maintain those standards
* A directory of projects and initiatives from the community that meet some or all of those criteria

TODO resources are open to everyone and available at (TODO Group GitHub repo)[https://github.com/todogroup] under `CC-BY 4.0 Licence`. We encourage people to share their knowledge and help growing this community by adding their contributions to the different TODO initiatives such as:
