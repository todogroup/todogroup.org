A critical element of any business or product strategy that includes the use of open source software is the reinvestment of resources into the projects on which that strategy relies. This can lead to the creation of open source commercial ecosystems, which contribute to the viability and long-term sustainability for those projects. However, before a company will invest resources it must first have confidence in a project’s future prospects such that they’re willing to build commercial dependencies upon it.

The TODO Group launched a [new OSPO guide](https://todogroup.org/guides/os-commercial-ecosystem/) to help to create and support sustainable open source projects. The guide covers:

* Defining and creating a sustainable open source commercial ecosystem
* Ingredients of open source ecosystem success
* How to build an open source ecosystem
* Example: Google Open Source Office

TODO OSPO guides transfer the knowledge from a wide range of OSPO initiatives across organizations. Take a look at [*Creating Open Source Commercial Ecosystsems*](https://todogroup.org/guides/os-commercial-ecosystem/)  and learn from well-known senior OSPO leaders working at Dropbox, Google, and VMWare.
