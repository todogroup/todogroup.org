The [TODO Group members](https://todogroup.org/about/members/) from Mercado Libre and Cuemby OSPO participated in [KCD Colombia 2025 🇨🇴](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-kcd-colombia-presents-kcd-colombia-2025/), showcasing how OSPO practices can enable sustainable Cloud Native adoption at one of the most relevant **Cloud Native community events** in the region. TODO OSPO Ambassadors **Fernando** and **Ángel** facilitated an **OSPOlogy LATAM** session as part of the event program.  

The mission of [OSPOlogyLive LATAM](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/ospo-latam-meetups/) is to encourage the promotion and adoption of Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) within organizations across Latin America, including Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and more. By aligning OSPO practices with the growing Cloud Native ecosystem, the session showed how open source strategy and governance directly support the sustainable adoption of cloud technologies.

### Fernando’s Presentation  

Fernando's presentation focused on educating organizations about starting an OSPO:  

- What an OSPO is, its benefits, and relevance  
- How to build an OSPO and manage its day-to-day operations  
- Core areas such as license compliance, open source consumption, and contribution

Fernando closed the session by presenting the [OSPO Book](https://ospobook.todogroup.org/), with a special note of gratitude to the many contributors who made these resources possible. His focus on education and knowledge sharing is at the heart of the ambassador mission — enabling more professionals to understand, create, and scale OSPOs.

### A Global Ambassador Community  

The work of ambassadors like Fernando and Ángel reflects a wider, global effort by the TODO Group. [The TODO OSPO ambassador community](https://todogroup.org/community/ambassadors/) spans Latin America, Japan, China, the Netherlands, Sweden, France, and beyond, all with the same mission: to **educate, advocate, and empower organizations** to adopt open source management best practices through the establishment of OSPOs.  

A big thank you to the organizers, our TODO members, and ambassadors for connecting the Cloud Native and OSPO communities in LATAM!
