[GitJobs](https://gitjobs.dev) is an open source job board powered by CNCF. Posting is free, listings run for 30 days, and jobs you tag for **OSPO** (under the "Foundation" category) will surface on the [TODO Group OSPO Jobs page](https://todogroup.org/jobs).

## Who should use this?

Roles in or adjacent to an **Open Source Program Office**, such as:

- OSPO Director / Manager  
- Open Source Compliance / Policy  
- InnerSource Program Manager  
- Open Source Governance  
- OSS Supply Chain / Security  
- Community / Developer Relations for OSPOs  


## Before you start

To post an OSPO job on GitJobs, you will need:

- An **LFX (Linux Foundation) account** (used for login)  
- Your **employer profile details**: company name, website, and logo  



## Step 1: Sign in

1. Go to [gitjobs.dev](https://gitjobs.dev) → **Log in**  
2. Choose **Linux Foundation SSO** and sign in (or create your LFX account)  


## Step 2: Set up your employer profile

After logging in, you’ll land in the dashboard. Create/complete your Employer profile:

- Company name  
- Logo  
- Website  
- Click Save



## Step 3: Create the job

Click **Post a job** and fill in the form:

### Basics
- **Job title**: include clear OSPO keywords (e.g., *OSPO Manager*, *Open Source Compliance Lead*)  
- Job type  
- Workplace  
- Location  
- Seniority  
- Compensation  

### Open Source specifics *(these drive visibility on GitJobs)*  

- **Open Source (job time %):** How much of the role is hands-on OSS work  
- **Upstream Commitment (employee time %):** Time your org provides for upstream projects it depends on  

➡️ Jobs with either/both are highlighted on GitJobs  

### Skills & context

- Required skills / tags  
- Application link or contact email  

### Foundation & projects *(critical for OSPO listing)*  

Under **“Projects you’d like to work on”**, set **Foundation:** and select **OSPO**  

This tagging ensures your role appears on the [TODO Group Jobs page](https://todogroup.org/jobs).  


## Step 4: Manage your listing

- **Duration:** Jobs are live for 30 days, then auto-archive  
- **Edit / Unpublish / Re-publish:** Use the Employer dashboard anytime  
- Note: Changes may take a few minutes to appear on the site and embeds
