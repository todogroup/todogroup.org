## Learning Space

Touchpoint meetings serve as a vendor-neutral space to discuss day-to-day challenges and develop best practices for people managing open source operations and strategy (AKA Open Source Program Offices) to integrate into the organization's overall infrastructure. We invite guests to deliver a brief presentation, followed by a Q&A session. Guests include:

- Representatives from open source projects and initiatives: including independent maintainers, core contributors and project managers
- Representatives from Foundations: including General managers, CTOs, and community managers from small to large ecosystems like the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Open Source Security Foundation, OpenChain, InnerSource Commons, LF Energy, CHAOSS, LF AI & Data Foundation, and more
- Organization's stakeholders: including C-level managers like CTOs
- Members of an OSPO: including open source ambassadors, developer relations professionals, project managers or directors

This collective effort help people to articulate the value of the OSPO work and gather insights to better integrate open source into the organization's infrastructure, worker's culture and operations.

There are two kinds of Touchpoints every month, with content being cross-shared between both sessions. Conversations are governed under Chatham House Rules.
