## STEP 1: Join the TODO Chat, Forum and OSPONews

The easiest way to stay updated on the latest trends in OSPOs, job positions, events, and studies is to [subscribe to the monthly OSPO Newsletter](../osponews/).

TODO uses [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/thetodogroup/shared_invite/zt-2l8r9czoi-vY8kYerIXGnBTmJFnApSLQ) for real-time communication and conversations are governed under [Chatham House Rules](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule). Within Slack, you'll find our `#general` channel, along with various regional and working group-focused channels ([learn more about TODO group's community structure](https://github.com/todogroup/governance/blob/main/TODO%20Structure/structure-mindmap.md)). Conversations in these chat channels are also anonymized and mirrored in the [OSPO forum via GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions).

Additionally, we offer [groups.io community mailing list](https://lists.todogroup.org/g/community). Joining this list will enable you to receive invitations to our monthly meetings and stay informed about important updates within the community.

Remember to check out our [OSPO guides](https://todogroup.org/resources/guides/) for more help getting your OSPO started or implementing best practices. If you have ideas for how we can better support you, [open a discussion](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions). We look forward to hearing from you!
