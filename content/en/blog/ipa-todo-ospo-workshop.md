On October 2, 2025, Japan‚Äôs [Information-technology Promotion Agency (IPA)](https://www.ipa.go.jp), a government agency operated under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, hosted a public briefing for its upcoming **‚ÄúOSPO Level-1‚Äù corporate workshop**, delivered in cooperation with the Linux Foundation‚Äôs **TODO Group**. The session explained how organizations in Japan can get started to establish open source governance bodies in their organization 
and how IPA will support both internal divisions and Japanese organizations on that journey. This post summarizes key takeaways from the OSPO Workshop briefing.

### IPA‚Äôs efforts to strengthen OSPO adoption in Japan

The IPA OSPO team presented concrete enablement initiatives aimed at helping organizations build internal governance structures. Through the IPA's Japan Open Source Hub, IPA is publishing and consolidating resources to increase open source literacy and offer repeatable learning experiences.

At the center of the Level-1 program is the [OSPO Starter Kit](https://www.ipa.go.jp/digital/kaihatsu/oss/events/ospo-workshop-flow.html), a collection guideline templates and even a workbook that participants adapt to their own environments. This resource enables teams to move from ‚Äúlearning‚Äù to ‚Äúdoing.‚Äù. IPA also shared details about the **OSPO Level-1 Workshop** series‚Äîa 
three-part, in-person program running on November 6, December 2, and January 22 with consultation sessions and guidance on how to implement the Starter Kit.

### Key insights from TODO Group

Ana Jim√©nez (Linux Foundation, TODO Group Project Manager) framed open source as part of today‚Äôs critical infrastructure and described why OSPOs need a seat early in the software lifecycle. She connected recent regulatory momentum (such as the **EU Cyber Resilience Act**, or the **U.S. CISA strategy**) with the practical need to embed secure development practices 
via OSPO processes rather than treating them as an afterthought.

Ana also emphasized the importance of positioning the OSPO as a governance hub for emerging technologies, including AI policy and AI-generated code management in collaboration with risk, legal, and platform teams. She highlighted the necessity of going beyond OSPO launch toward sustainability, encouraging organizations to use ROI reporting and long-term funding 
to maintain open source capabilities.  

A theme that resonated with attendees was the ‚Äúopen source stagnation cycle,‚Äù which is characterized by organizations urging developers to ‚Äúcontribute more‚Äù without a clear strategy, policy, or reporting model.

> "This leads to confusion and reduced support. An OSPO helps *break that loop by defining methods, processes, and tools that link contributions to measurable business goals"

> Ana Jim√®nez

Finally, Ana introduced practical tools within TODO for Japanese teams within organizations looking for training materials and to support their open source strategy, such as **the OSPO definition in Japanese**, **OSS policy templates**, and the **OSPO Book**, which provide actionable guidance to accelerate OSPO maturity.

### Continuing collaboration between IPA and TODO Group

TODO Group will continue collaborating with IPA by sharing open educational resources, policy templates, and case studies, while connecting Japan-based practitioners with the global OSPO community and local initiatives such as the OpenChain & TODO [OSPO Local Japan Meetups Group](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/ospo-local-meetup-japan-japanese-speaking/).  

To keep the conversation around OSPO adoption in Japan going, join us at the OSPOCon track during [Open Source Summit Japan](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-japan/), taking place December 8‚Äì10, 2025, in Tokyo and don‚Äôt miss the expert-led panel [OSPOjp: Ways To Level up OSPO Stages With Knowledge and Strategies From Local Meetup Japan](https://ossjapan2025.sched.com/event/29Fl2/panel-ospojp-ways-to-level-up-ospo-stages-with-knowledge-and-strategies-from-local-meetup-japan-masayuki-kuwata-sony-group-corporation-ana-jimenez-santamaria-linux-foundation-kiyoshi-owada-socionext-inc-takanori-suzuki-hirotaka-motai-cybert?iframe=yes&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) to hear directly from community leaders driving open source governance forward.
