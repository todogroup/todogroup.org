# About the group

Open source is part of the fabric of each of our companies. Between us, our open
source programs enable us to use, contribute to, and maintain, thousands of
projects - both large and small.

These programs face many challenges, including ensuring high-quality and
frequent releases, engaging with developer communities, and using and
contributing back to other projects effectively.

The [members of this group](/members) are committed to working together in order
to overcome these challenges. We will be sharing experiences, developing best
practices, and working on common tooling. But we can’t do this alone. If you are
a company using or sharing open source, we welcome you [to join us](/join) and
help make this happen.

**TODO: talk openly, develop openly.** We believe we can better improve our open
source programs - and our contributions to the open source movement as a whole -
by working together.
