The TODO Group is thrilled to share a new community resource: “The Lifecycle of an Open Source Program Office (OSPO): From Inception to Strategic Pivoting”, originally authored by Dr. Ibrahim Haddad, long-time TODO Group contributor.

This whitepaper provides a framework to help organizations understand and evolve their OSPOs—from grassroots beginnings and executive sponsorship, to scaling contributions, integrating open source into core strategy, 
and reorienting toward new technologies like AI. Endorsed by the TODO Group, it reflects real-world patterns and lessons learned from OSPOs across our global community over the past years.

> This report shares real-world patterns seen across the TODO community and reinforces a key truth: OSPOs are not static. These offices need to evolve with organizational priorities and innovation trends.

## What’s Inside?

- An updated view of OSPOs in 2025 landscape (including AI system adoption, software supply chain resilience, and regulatory alignment)
- How OSPOs typically form, evolve, and pivot
- Tactical advice on license compliance, executive buy-in, InnerSource, and developer enablement
- Global perspectives from China and Europe OSPOs on regulation, strategy, and risk
- The concept of an OSPO as a “strategic risk radar”

> OSPOs looking to adapt to the new economy and the AI landscape should embrace a flexible, cyclical journey rather than a linear progression. Their phases must evolve, repeat, or pivot as organizational priorities shift and external conditions change.
> The Lifecycle of an OSPO reinforces and illustrates this continuous evolution, helping organizations build a resilient software strategy that integrates holistic open source practices.

## A Living Resource for the Community

This idea began as a personal initiative by Ibrahim, who generously contributed this work as a TODO community resource under CC-BY 4.0 and to seed a collaborative, shared framework that OSPO practitioners can evolve together. 
We’re now publishing it as part of the [TODO Group’s ospology GitHub repository](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/tree/main/whitepapers/ospo-lifecycle) and this website to ensure it’s accessible and extensible by the community. 

The paper will also be highlighted during the APAC & EMEA TODO Touchpoint on May 29.

We invite the TODO community  to build on it, share your feedback, or propose additions.
