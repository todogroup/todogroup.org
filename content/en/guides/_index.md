We collect best practices from the leading companies engaged in open source development and aim to help your organization successfully implement and run an open source program office. For guides tailored to individual contributors, we recommend GitHubâ€™s [community guides](https://github.com/github/opensource.guide).

## Open Source Program Office (OSPO) 101 Course

It is intended to be a modularized so the content is reusable in a piecemeal fashion.
