**2. Review**
* TODO steering committee team reviews proposal within 30 working days
* If the proposal meets the criteria, the TODO PM sends a case study pack to the contact info provided
* If the proposal doesn’t meet the criteria, TODO Program Manager will provide feedback and the organization is invited to resubmit.

**3. Creation**

Primary contact writes a case study following the required style documented in the case study pack

**4. Editing**
