Open Source initiatives within organizations face many challenges, such as:

* Educating developers to good open source practices
* Building policies and infrastructure around the open source projects that matters to them
* Ensuring high-quality and frequent releases
* Engaging with developer communities
* Contributing back to other projects effectively

Overall, organizations need some guidance to start and keep advancing in
their [OSPO Journey](https://linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/LFResearch_OSPO_Report.pdf).

The community and [General Members](/members) of this group are committed to working together in order to overcome these challenges. We will be sharing experiences, developing best
practices, and working on common tooling. But we canâ€™t do this alone. If you are willing to advance in your open source journey, we welcome you to [join the community](/community).
Organizations with an established OSPO or similar open source initiative, can also [support](/join) TODO becoming General Members.
