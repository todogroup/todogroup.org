title: Guides and Resources
---
The TODO Group offers a **Maturity Model**, a set of **Guides**, a **Mind Map**, a **101 Course**, **Annual Surveys**, as well as **Case Studies**, to help organizations advance in their OSPO journey. These OSPO resources are developed by the TODO Group in collaboration with The Linux Foundation and the larger open source community. We expect these resources to be living documents that evolve via community contributions.
