## Touchpoint Meetings

Touchpoints are collaborative sessions designed to foster a safe and open environment for the community to share experiences and explore best practices in open source program management. These sessions also explore its impact and relationship with cross-disciplinary themes, including security, AI infrastructure, compliance, community health, business strategy, and more. Touchpoints are offered in two different timeframes to ensure geographic availability:

- APAC & EMEA Touchpoints: Thursdays, 12:00 PM GMT
- AMER & EMEA Touchpoints: Mondays, 5:00 PM GMT

Confirmed sessions are shared in [TODO Group Community Calendar](https://todogroup.org/community/meetings/#calendar). More information about the planned agenda and program can be found in the [ospology repo](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/tree/main/meetings)
