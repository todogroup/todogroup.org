## Introduction

As part of the **OSPO Roadshow** initiated by the **Linux Foundation APAC OSPO SIG**, we have been visiting various companies across China since 2021 — including China Mobile Research Institute, Red Hat China, Didi, ZTE, and GitLab China — to share and exchange experiences about open source and enterprise collaboration.

In 2024, this community activity officially became part of the **TODO Group China Chapter**, further strengthening collaboration among local OSPOs.  
On November 7, 2025, the OSPO Roadshow arrived at [Midea Group’s headquarters](https://www.midea.es/proyectos-destacados/midea-headquarter-building/) in Shunde, Foshan, Guangdong Province.

## Highlights and Key Discussions

### 1. Cold Start Challenges for Open Source Projects and Events — *Hanqin Wu*

Hanqin shared practical approaches to solving the “cold start” problem in open source communities — how to move from **0 to 1**, and then **1 to 100**.  
Topics included:
- How to attract and motivate volunteers in early project stages  
- How to manage both code and non-code contributors  
- How to build an information platform to consolidate open source events  
- How to help companies transition from “wanting to open source” to actually executing it  

This interactive session sparked strong discussion among attendees.

### 2. Why OSPO? Embedding Modern Management Practices — *Jiansheng Li*

Jiansheng explored the unique operational logic of open source collaboration — what he called the **“third mode of operation”**, distinct from traditional industrial management.  
Drawing on examples such as **Linux Foundation**, **Android**, **IBM WebSphere**, and **Red Hat Ansible**, he illustrated how organizations can adapt management structures to embrace open source innovation, through lenses of **law, economics, and organizational management**.

### 3. Open Source Compliance for Embedded Software — *Ye Tao*

Ye Tao shared insights from real-world compliance practices, discussing the **special requirements and challenges** of open source governance in embedded software environments.

### 4. OSPO Reflections and Practices — *Zhentao Yang*

Zhentao offered an impromptu reflection on OSPO operations and cross-company collaboration, emphasizing the importance of community-driven innovation and shared learning.
