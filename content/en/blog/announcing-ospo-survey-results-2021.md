# OSPO Survey Results 2021

The TODO Group is happy to announce the fourth annual Open Source Program Management Survey results that examines the prevalence and outcomes of open source programs, including the key benefits and barriers to adoption. 
We have [open sourced all of our survey results and graphics](https://github.com/todogroup/survey/tree/master/2021).

## Key Findings

The findings indicated there are many opportunities ahead to educate companies about how OSPOs can benefit them.


* **OSPO Structure:** Professionalization continued among OSPOs, with 58% of those programs formally structured, up from 54% the previous year. Prospects for more funding brightened compared to 2020.

* **OSPO Benefits and Responsibilities:** OSPOs had a positive impact on their sponsors’ software practices, but their benefits differed depending on the size of an organization.

* **Planning an OSPO:** Companies that intended to start an OSPO hoped it would increase innovation, but setting a strategy and a budget remained top challenges to their goals.

* **Organizations without an OSPO:** Almost half of survey participants without an OSPO believed it would help their company, but of those that didn’t think it would help, 35% said they haven’t even considered it.

* **Value of Open Source Participation:** 27% of survey participants said a company’s open source participation is at least very influential in their organization’s buying decisions.


The TODO Group is committed to advancing the state of open source program management across the industry and will be performing this survey on an annual basis. We look forward to community feedback on this survey and how we can improve it in the future.
