Since 2018, the TODO Group and Linux Foundation Research have conducted yearly open surveys to assess the state of open source programs and similar initiatives worldwide.  
Today, we are pleased to announce the launch of the **2025 call for sponsors** for organizations interested in supporting this effort and making the 7th edition possible. Taking insights from the [2024 State of OSPO Report](https://todogroup.org/blog/state-of-ospo-2024/), this year we aim to dive deeper into **core cross-skilling areas** where open source professionals within organizations and OSPO teams are specializing, including **managing security issues** and **managing GenAI infrastructure**.


### Potential Areas for Exploration in the Role of Open Source Managers and OSPO Teams 

The 2025 survey offers the possibility to study the role and impact of Open Source Management and OSPO teams in areas such as: 

- Collaboration between industries to evaluate the openness of AI and GenAI systems and models, develop best practices, or create open solutions  
- Collaboration with security teams and CISOs to manage risks, comply with regulatory requirements, and ensure developers and stakeholders are equipped with effective open source security knowledge and tools  
- Management of AI and Generative AI systems, models, and infrastructure** within organizations, supporting internal teams in AI literacy and best practices
- Influence on funding decisions and sustainable investment in open source projects.  

The results of this survey will help open source professionals better understand the value of OSPOs and open source management, not only in organizations relying on software projects but also in those involved with hardware, open content, AI models, and data used for training models.  

The survey is relevant to:  
- Representatives from organizations working in or alongside OSPOs or similar entities, including those involved in open source in any capacity.  
- Representatives from organizations closely associated with OSPOs, such as managers, executives, policymakers, and key decision-makers in digital/IT strategy and operations related to open source management.  
- Students and individuals exploring a transition into open source roles and OSPO-like entities to gain insights into the status of OSPOs worldwide.
