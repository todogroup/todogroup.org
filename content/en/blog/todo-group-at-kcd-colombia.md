The [TODO Group members](https://todogroup.org/about/members/) from Mercado Libre and Cuemby OSPO participated in [KCD Colombia 2025 üá®üá¥](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-kcd-colombia-presents-kcd-colombia-2025/), showcasing how OSPO practices can enable sustainable Cloud Native adoption at one of the most relevant **Cloud Native community events** in the region. TODO OSPO Ambassadors **Fernando** and **√Ångel** facilitated an **OSPOlogy LATAM** session as part of the event program.  

The mission of [OSPOlogyLive LATAM](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/ospo-latam-meetups/) is to encourage the promotion and adoption of Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) within organizations across Latin America, including Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and more. By aligning OSPO practices with the growing Cloud Native ecosystem, the session showed how open source strategy and governance directly support the sustainable adoption of cloud technologies.

[The TODO OSPO ambassador community](https://todogroup.org/community/ambassadors/) spans Latin America, Japan, China, the Netherlands, Sweden, France, and beyond, all with the same mission: to **educate, advocate, and empower organizations** to adopt open source management best practices through the establishment of OSPOs.
