## What is the role of the Steering Committee?  

In TODO, it is the community that shapes project initiatives. The Steering Committee exists to support the community by helping drive progress. They serve by ensuring that TODO’s strategic goals are aligned with the mission, that these goals are met, and that community voices are heard. SC members are responsible for:

1. Attending monthly calls to coordinate with the program manager and oversee day-to-day operations.  
2. Defining yearly strategic goals based on community input.  
3. Approving, modifying, or discontinuing project initiatives, working groups, and real-time chat channels using the TODO Group name, logo, or branding.  
4. Approving the use of the TODO Group’s identity for sponsorships or endorsements.  
5. Establishing and upholding policies, rules, and procedures for participants and the project.  


## Who is eligible to be a Candidate?  

Any individual can become a candidate by submitting the application form. However, people who actively engage with the TODO community or its projects are more likely to be elected. Examples of active participation include:  

- Being a representative from a **General Member**, an **Associate organization**, or serving as a **TODO Ambassador**  
- Maintaining or actively contributing to any of the **TODO GitHub repositories**  
- Hosting **TODO-supported events** (e.g, OSPO Local Chapters led by TODO Ambassadors) or participating in the **OSPOlogyLive EU series**  

## Who is eligible to Vote?  

There are two types of Steering Committee seats:  

- **Elected seats**: TODO General Members’ main contact reviews candidate applications and casts their votes during October.  
- **Appointed seats**: Current Steering Committee members appoint candidates from the 2026 list.
