#Move Fast, Open Source#

<small>(because companies love open&nbsp;source too)</small>

---

We are a [guild of companies](#members) that run dedicated open source programs, in order
to:

* Give back to open source engineering communities
* Share the technical challenges that we face & help overcome
* Accelerate innovation throughout the broader technology industry

We believe that sharing our work through our programs can help to make other
companies and developers more successful.

##Commitment##

Each of the companies in this guild are committed to running their open source
programs in a disciplined and responsible way.

We strive to hold ourselves to a set of best practices for running the projects
that are showcased by this guild:

* We run the software in a production environment
* We accept contributions from the community
* We activity engage the community
* The software is thoroughly tested
* The software is well documented
* The software is clearly licensed

We each understand that we must be good stewards of our open source projects in
order for them to be valuable for others to use.
