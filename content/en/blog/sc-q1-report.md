This is the Q1 2025 review provided by the TODO Steering Committee (SC), sharing the progress made on the approved strategic goals for the year. 
These efforts reflect input from the [2024 end-of-year review](https://todogroup.org/blog/end-of-year-2024/), the TODO AMA session at LFMS 2024, and the [2024 OSPO Survey](https://todogroup.org/blog/state-of-ospo-2024/), highlighting key trends 
and challenges in open source program management.

## What's New?

🎯 **2025 Strategic Goals Approved**: The SC reviewed and approved the 2025 goals based on challenges identified through community feedback and ecosystem analysis. This year’s focus is to strengthen collaboration, contributor recognition, process clarity, and communication.

📋 **Kanban-Based Transparency**: Strategic goal progress is being tracked in a public **Kanban-style phased board**, allowing all participants to monitor task status.

### 2025 Strategic Goals:

1. **Develop Shared Goals with Partner Communities**  
2. **Establish Touchpoint Committee & Plan in Advance Sessions with Speakers**  
3. **Recognize TODO Contributors and Build Processes**  
4. **TODO Repo Maintenance and Clean-Up**  

## Q1 Progress Highlights

📘 **Ambassador Guidelines Updated**: Revised and published with clearer [onboarding and engagement expectations](https://github.com/todogroup/governance/blob/main/TODO-OSPO-Ambassador-Program.md).

🗓️ **Touchpoint Planning Agenda Created** A structured [agenda](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/tree/main/meetings/Agenda_2025#todo-touchpoint-agenda-overview-january---june-2025) now invites members to: Share past conference talks; Introduce new tools/initiatives; Propose hot topics for discussion; Join open forums under Chatham House Rule  

> This new structure brought a 114% increase in participation compared to 2024 Q1.

🎓 **First TODO Certification Launched**: In collaboration with the Open Source Initiative and LF Education, we launched the first TODO certification:[Certified Open Source Developer for Enterprise Code](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-open-source-developer-for-enterprise-code/)

🔄 **Steering Committee Member Update**: One of the SC members, **Nik Peters**, has stepped down from their role. We’re grateful for Nik’s contributions to TODO, including sharing Porsche’s OSPO journey in the OSPO Book and participating in the TODO 10th Anniversary video. Following the results of the last SC elections, **Alice Sowerby** will fill the vacant seat through December 2025. Alice is one of the OSPO Book chairs, a highly active TODO contributor, and contributor to the CHAOSS podcast. **Welcome, Alice!**

🔐 **Closer Connection with Security**: Representatives from Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) actively participated in **OSPOlogyLive Amsterdam**, sharing open source management guidance for security teams to open source managers. Moreover, a full **Security Chapter** (Chapter 5) has been featured in the OSPO Book as a result of this collaboration.

🤝 **Sustain Partnerships to Integrate Standards and Specifications into OSPO Practices**: TODO supported and participated in the [OpenChain and Friends](https://openchainproject.org/) held in Stuttgart in April.

> While TODO focuses on policy and process choices for effectively open source engagements within organizations, OpenChain provides process management standards, alongside practical guides, to ensure trusted and consistent open source license, security, and other compliance across the supply chain. Together, the two Linux Foundation projects offer complementary approaches to strategic open source management, with both communities regularly exchanging information and resources

🎓 **Stronger Ties with Academia**: TODO is advancing conversations on **industry–academic OSPO collaboration**, particularly through its connection with the **CURIOSS** community. [CURIOSS officially joined TODO as an associate member in Q1](https://todogroup.org/blog/todo-associate-curioss/)

💬 **TODO AMA Sessions at LF Events**: TODO SC members are organizing **Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions** during **Linux Foundation Member Summit** and **Open Source Summits** in 2025 to connect with members and contributors, gather feedback, and discuss proposals and challenges together. The next AMA is [scheduled for OSSummit NA](https://sched.co/1zfiJ).
