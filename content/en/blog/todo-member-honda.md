We are excited to announce that Honda Motor Co., Ltd. has joined the Linux Foundation’s TODO Group as a General Member!

## Honda’s Engagement with Open Source

Honda has been steadily advancing its open source strategy as part of its transition toward software-defined mobility. At Open Source Summit Japan 2025, [Honda shared its OSPO journey and vision](https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/ossjapan2025/36/20251209_OSS2025_Honda-keynote-v1.2.pdf) through a keynote titled *“Honda’s OSPO Challenge: Accelerating Strategic Collaboration with the Open Source Community”*, presented by **Kazuo Tsubouchi, Executive Chief Engineer and Head of Honda OSPO**. It's OSPO was formally established in April 2025, following several years of progressive OSS governance work across in-vehicle systems and software-defined vehicle (SDV) development. Key milestones in Honda’s OSPO journey include:

- Establishment of organization-wide OSS policies and processes  
- Self-certification against **ISO/IEC 5230 (OpenChain)** for open source license compliance  
- Self-certification against **ISO/IEC 18974 (OpenChain Security Assurance Specification)**  
- Deployment of **SBOM operations (SPDX 2 Lite)** and commercial SCA tooling  
- Integration of OSS governance into SDV-wide development processes  

Honda’s OSPO roadmap aligns closely with the [TODO Group’s OSPO maturity model](https://ospobook.todogroup.org/03-chapter/#maturity-model-3---the-ospo-maturity-model-by-the-todo-group-7), progressing from adoption and compliance toward deeper community engagement and leadership. Honda has publicly stated its goal of becoming a **strategic decision-making partner** through open source by FY2026, while expanding community participation and hosting OSS projects as part of its SDV strategy  [oai_citation:2‡20251209_OSS2025_Honda-keynote-v1.2.pdf](sediment://file_000000008bbc71f484e3ef12318b0480).
