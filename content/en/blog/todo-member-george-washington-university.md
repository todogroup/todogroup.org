We are excited to announce that George Washington University has joined the Linux Foundation’s TODO Group as a General Member

## George Washington University’s Engagement with Open Source

George Washington University (GW)  has built a strong and intentional open source community, supported by an [Open Source Program Office (OSPO)](https://ospo.gwu.edu/about) established two years ago. The OSPO has planted a clear institutional flag for all things open, spanning open source software, open access, open educational resources, 
open data, and open science.

## Engagement with the TODO Group

George Washington University is excited to collaborate with open source advocates across the Linux Foundation's TODO Group community and to help strengthen connections between industry and academia.

## About TODO
