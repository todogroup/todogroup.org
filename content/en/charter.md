Disclaimer: Please note this charter covers the activities and
responsibilities of general members and the steering committee. There
are many other folks active in TODO Group, such as individuals employed
by OSPO Associate Organizations and individuals who are OSPO
practitioners and contributors to open source projects and communities.
Individual persons are welcome and encouraged to join and participate in
the TODO Group as long as they abide by our code of conduct. For

1.  **Mission of the TODO Group (“TODO”).** The TODO Group’s primary
    focus is to identify key policy and process choices related to
    corporate open source engagement and create tools and educational
    materials that promote best practices around such engagements.

2.  **General Membership** The TODO Group General Members are composed
    of individuals deeply involved in running open source offices,
    tasked to drive open source across divisions and product lines
    within their organization. These individuals have learned from
    practical experience what it takes to successfully engage in or
    create open source offices and build effective internal open source
    education and initiatives that guide how developers and
    non-developers in their organization engage in external
    communities.

    Members. Anyone may participate as a General Member as long as they
    meet the General Member Qualifications. At such time as a General
