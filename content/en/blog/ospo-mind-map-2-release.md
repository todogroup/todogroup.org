TODO Group is proud to [announce a new OSPO mind map version](https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/) release. The mind map schemes the main Open Source program Office&#39;s responsibilities, roles, behavior, and team size within the Ecosystem. This post shows the major improvements done by the community in the new OPSO Mind Map version

## Updates on `Responsibilities` section

OSPO Mind Map `Responsibilities` section has new OSPO-specific topics and different sub-sections defined, including:

* 📘 Develop and Execute Open Source Strategy

* 🧭 Eliminate Friction from Using and Contributing to Open Source

* 🖥️ Manage Open Source IT Infrastructure

* 📚 Give Advice on Open Source

* 🫶 Grow and Retain Open Source Talent Inside the Organization

* 🤝 Implement InnerSource Practices

* ⏱️ Track Performance Metrics

* 🤝 Collaborate with Open Source Organizations

* 📈 Prioritize and Drive Open Source Upstream Development

* 📝 Establish and Improve Open Source Policies and Processes

* 🔍 Oversee Open Source Compliance

* 📒 Support Corporate Development Activities

Initial PR with these changes can be found [here](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/pull/111).

**Welcoming Contributors 👋**

The TODO Community welcomes more contributors to the OSPO mind Map to bring together the various communities involved in OSPO-specific topics. This will help to improve open source professionals&#39; guidance across the OSPO ecosystem (e.g topics like &quot;IneerSource&quot;, &quot;Open Source metrics&quot;, &quot;Open Source Compliance&quot; and more).

## Updates on display

Initially, the mind map displayed all sections by default, showing a huge mind map image. Now, when people access [https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/](https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/) the display view will only show the first 2 levels, so people can expand specific sections, avoiding unnecessary information and focusing on what matters to them at that time.
