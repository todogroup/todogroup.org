*Leading figures from Open Source gathered at OSPOCon and OSPOCon Europe to discuss the new OSPO Era challenges and ways to help the Open Source movement*

OSPOCon has demonstrated to be a key networking space to learn and connect with OSPO professionals across organizations: Attendants were able to learn from open source leaders who shared their experiences on ways to establish and run an OSPO, the status of emerging open source initiatives raising within organizations across industries, as well as the evolution of OSPOs worldwide.

Both conferences brought insightful conversations from Open Source Initiatives in banking, finance, automotive, NGOs, governments, hardware companies, and more, highlighting the [growing interest for OSPOS far beyond traditional tech companies](https://thenewstack.io/more-organizations-report-benefits-of-open-source-programs).

## Getting involved in TODO: Organizations committed to Open Source

*“There is no broad template for building an open source program that applies across all industries — or even across all organizations in a single industry. That can make its creation a challenge, but you can learn lessons from other organizations (companies, academic institutions, governments, and more) and bring them together to fit your own organization’s requirements."*

TODO is an open group of 70+ organizations that want to collaborate on practices, tools, and other ways to run successful and effective open source projects and programs. Open Source professionals can contribute by adding resources to any of our five OSPO pillars:

* Tools
* Network
* Education
* Training
* Research

Let's keep building healthy and successful Open Source initiatives for organizations together!
