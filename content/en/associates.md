## What is the OSPO Associate Program and the OSPO Associates?

The OSPO Associate is a TODO Program that aims to work collaboratively across communities that are helping the OSPO movement to build the most comprehensive OSPO solutions infrastructure and network.

Entities decide to apply for OSPO Associate Program for many reasons, including:

* Brand value in demonstrating their open source efforts to help the OSPO movement
* Brand value in demonstrating their support to TODO mission and community
* Brand value in demonstrating they are actively collaborating with TODO to build and improve OSPO-related resources and tooling

## Who can request to be an OSPO Associate?

As an *OSPO Associate*, your organization needs to be focused on [OSPO-related topics](https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/). An OSPO Associate may not necessarily have an OSPO, but aims to collaborate with TODO to improve OSPO adoption and education, resources, and initiatives.

Entities who can apply for OSPO Associate include:

* Open Source Communities and or projects
* Academia
* Governments
* Non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
* Non-profit Organizations (NPO)

The OSPO Associates program is not intended for service providers. Individuals can always [join the community](https://todogroup.org/community/) and access our resources, following [TODO's code of conduct](https://github.com/todogroup/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#todo-group-code-of-conduct).

Note: if your organization (e.g academia, government, NGO) has a formal and recognized open source strategy, center of excellence around open source or Open Source Program Office (OSPO), please consider [supporting and sponsoring TODO as General Member](https://todogroup.org/members/) to be entitled to General Member benefits.

Being promoted as an OSPO Associate, means that your organization is committed to collaborating with other peers to enrich the OSPO resources, tools, and services infrastructure and offer better assistance to OSPO.

2) Wait until the TODO PM checks if the organization meets the criteria and approves / declines the request

3) If the request is accepted, please open a pull request to add it to [landscape.yml](https://github.com/todogroup/ospolandscape/blob/master/landscape.yml) under OSPO Adopter category and OSPO Associate subcategory. For the logo, you can either upload an SVG to the **hosted_logos** directory or put a URL as the value, and it will be fetched.

Netlify will generate a staging server for you to preview your updates. Please check that the logo and information appear correctly and then add LGTM to the pull request confirming your review and requesting a merge.

*If you have any issues, you can ask TODO PM to do this process for you instead.*

## Where can I find more info?

There are a lot of initiatives & resources where an OSPO Associate can get involved that are listed in the [TODO Guides and Resources](todogroup.org/guides).
