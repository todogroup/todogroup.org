Our plans include work such as:

* Sharing best practices for running open source programs and initiatives within organizations
* Codifying criteria or qualities that well-run projects should aspire to
* Tooling & instrumentation that makes it easier to reach and maintain those standards
* A directory of projects and initiatives from the community that meet some or all of those criteria
