We’re excited to share that the **8th annual State of OSPOs and Open Source Management Survey** is live!  
We are thankful to the survey sponsors who make this edition possible, and to our amazing distribution partners 🙏

This year's theme explores how your organization manages open source and how OSPOs influence key areas like **AI, cloud-native, software security**, and **regulatory readiness**. Moreover, 
there's a **new section** to explore the consequences of **dissolving or downsizing OSPOs**, and to identify trends in **organizational restructuring** driven by emerging priorities and shifts in technology.

The survey takes just **5–10 minutes** to complete. If you have a moment, we’d love for you to fill it out and share it with your network:
