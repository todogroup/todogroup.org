Since 2018, the TODO Group and Linux Foundation Research have conducted yearly open surveys to assess the state of open source programs and similar initiatives worldwide.  
Today, we are pleased to announce the launch of the **2025 call for sponsors** for organizations interested in supporting this effort and making the 7th edition possible.

Taking insights from the [2024 State of OSPO Report](https://todogroup.org/blog/state-of-ospo-2024/), this year we aim to dive deeper into **core cross-skilling areas** where open 
source professionals within organizations and OSPO teams are specializing, including **managing security issues** and **managing GenAI infrastructure**.


### Potential Areas for Exploration in the Role of Open Source Managers and OSPO Teams 

The 2025 survey aims to focus on the role and impact of Open Source Managers and OSPO Teams in the following specializations: 

- **Adoption and management of Generative AI systems and models** within organizations  
- **Collaboration between industries** to evaluate and classify the openness of GenAI systems and models and share best practices.  
- **Security and compliance in open source software,** including collaboration with security teams and CISOs to manage risks and regulatory requirements.  
- **Education and knowledge sharing on AI usage,** with a focus on how OSPOs support internal teams in AI literacy and best practices.  
- **Open source security awareness across the software supply chain,** ensuring developers and stakeholders are equipped with effective security strategies.  
- **The strategic influence of OSPOs and open source managers on funding decisions,** advocating for sustainable investment in open source projects and AI initiatives.  

The results of this survey will help open source professionals better understand the value of OSPO s—not only in organizations relying on software projects but also in those involved with hardware, open content, AI models, and data used for training models.  

The survey is relevant to:  
* Representatives from organizations working in or alongside OSPOs or similar entities, including those involved in open source in any capacity.  
* Representatives from organizations closely associated with OSPOs, such as managers, executives, policymakers, and key decision-makers in digital/IT strategy and operations related to open source management.  
* Students and individuals exploring a transition into open source roles and OSPO-like entities to gain insights into the status of OSPOs worldwide.
