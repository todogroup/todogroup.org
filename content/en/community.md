If you‚Äôre new to TODO Group, or to OSPOs, we encourage you to join one of our upcoming OSPOlogy sessions. 

These virtual, monthly calls focus on open source program best practices, and allow community members to learn from each other.

You can join an [upcoming session](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/todo-group/) to ask the experts questions, or even sign up to teach one!

We also have regular [OSPOlogy discussions](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions). Browse the current topics, or open a new one. Make sure to join us on Slack so that you can get the most out of it. 

Remember to check out our [OSPO guides](https://todogroup.org/guides/) for more help getting your OSPO started or implementing best practices. If you have ideas for how we can better support you, [open a discussion](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions). We look forward to hearing from you!
