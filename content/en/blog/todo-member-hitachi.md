## About TODO

The Linux Foundation’s TODO Group supports organizations in establishing and fostering strategic and sustainable open source engagements with open source projects and their community by addressing common challenges and openly sharing best practices for successful and sustainable implementation. 

General Members of the TODO Group are representatives from organizations actively engaged in open source management and strategy. They are responsible for driving open source adoption across divisions and product lines. A proven pattern to enable this adoption and a holistic approach is the establishment 
of Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs). By joining TODO, your organization can also contribute to the growth and continuous update of best practices, ensuring more organizations can successfully engage with open source.
