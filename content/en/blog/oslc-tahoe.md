The TODO Group will be hosting a formal open source office track at the Open Source Leadership Summit in Tahoe next year.

We hosted a track last year and encourage the wider community to <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-leadership-summit/program/cfp">submit your proposals</a>. We are especially interested in proposals that examine the structure of existing open source programs, what has helped those programs succeed (or fail!), how company culture has shaped those programs, and any lessons learned along the way. We would also love to present case studies that examine the process of open sourcing a project - the good, the bad and the ugly.

Good luck, we look forward to seeing you in Tahoe!
