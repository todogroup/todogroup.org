TODO Group is pleased to welcome the Information-technology Promotion Agency, Japan (IPA) as a new General Member. IPA is a Japanese government-related organization under the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). 
Its mission includes improving Japan’s cybersecurity posture, supporting industrial digital transformation, and fostering the human talent and infrastructure needed for a “super-smart” digital society. As part of this work, IPA has become a key 
hub for open source promotion activities in Japan, helping organizations understand how to use, contribute to, and sustainably govern open source software.

In recent years, IPA has renewed and expanded its open source initiatives under the umbrella of the “Japan Open Source Hub.” This initiative aims to connect government, industry, and academia around open source strategy, 
software assurance, and digital infrastructure. Through the Japan Open Source Hub, IPA is working to:

- Promote best practices for open source governance and compliance
- Support the use of open source in critical systems and public services
- Enable collaboration between companies, universities, and public institutions on shared open source components and standards

This membership builds on the growing collaboration between IPA and TODO Group around OSPO education and awareness in Japan. Earlier this year, IPA hosted an “OSPO Level-1” workshop in cooperation with TODO Group, 
focusing on the fundamentals of open source program offices. The workshop helped organizations in Japan understand:

- Why OSPOs and OSPO-like structures are useful for managing open source at scale
- The basic building blocks of open source governance (policies, processes, roles)
- How to start formalizing open source responsibilities inside an organization

## About TODO

The Linux Foundation’s TODO Group supports organizations in establishing and fostering strategic and sustainable open source engagements by addressing common challenges and openly sharing best practices for successful implementation.

General Members of the TODO Group are representatives from organizations actively engaged in open source management and strategy. They are responsible for driving open source adoption across divisions and product lines. A proven pattern to enable this adoption is the establishment of Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs). By joining TODO, your organization can contribute to the growth and continuous update of best practices, ensuring more organizations can successfully engage with open source.
