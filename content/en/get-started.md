## STEP 1: Join the TODO Chat, Forum and OSPONews

The easiest way to stay updated on the latest trends in OSPOs, job positions, events, and studies is to [subscribe to the monthly OSPO Newsletter](../osponews/).

TODO uses [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/thetodogroup/shared_invite/zt-2w71kclgx-JOUB4LTXIuVEKehkJk7V0w) for real-time communication and conversations are governed under [Chatham House Rules](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/chatham-house-rule). Within Slack, you'll find our `#general` channel, along with various regional and working group-focused channels ([learn more about TODO group's community structure](https://github.com/todogroup/governance/blob/main/TODO%20Structure/structure-mindmap.md)). Conversations in these chat channels are also anonymized and mirrored in the [OSPO forum via GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions).

Additionally, we offer [groups.io community mailing list](https://lists.todogroup.org/g/community). Joining this list will enable you to receive invitations to our monthly meetings and stay informed about important updates within the community.

OSPO resources by TODO are open to everyone and available at TODO Group GitHub repo under CC-BY 4.0 Licence. You can see all the resources in the resources section on the website. Remember to check out our [OSPO guides](https://todogroup.org/resources/guides/) for more help getting your OSPO started or implementing best practices. If you have ideas for how we can better support you, [open a discussion](https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions). We look forward to hearing from you!
