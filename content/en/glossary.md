{{< intro >}}
The world of open source is vast and complex, with many different terms and concepts that can be difficult to navigate. Our aim with this glossary is not to provide a definitive or general definition of these terms, but to clarify what we mean specifically under the context of an OSPO framework (stratey, governance, compliance and community) for organizations.
