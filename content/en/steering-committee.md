{{< intro >}}
We elect members to the TODO Group Steering Committee every year. These members collaborate with TODO Groupâ€™s Project Manager to ensure TODO initiatives align with the TODO mission. They develop project processes and documentation, advise on marketing matters, 
provide resolutions for community requests, and help define the strategic goals of the TODO Group community. [See our charter.](https://github.com/todogroup/governance/blob/main/GM-SC-CHARTER.adoc)
