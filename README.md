## üß© Building the site

This site is built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). In order to build the site, you'll need to install Hugo:

```bash
# macOS
brew install hugo
```

You'll also need to pull in the theme:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

- which theme is used
- how to update the theme
- what files you should edit to customise the look

## Running the site locally

TODO: Requires update as of 15th August 2023

If you want to edit the content of the site locally:

```bash
hugo server \
  --disableFastRender \
  --buildDrafts \
  --buildFuture \
  --ignoreCache
```

This will run the site on `localhost:1313`. Just navigate to http://localhost:1313 in your browser and you should see the site running.
