Yes, TODO Group resources are essentially like any other open source project.

Everyone willing to contribute to improve OSPO education and adoption across industries worldwide is more than welcome to join the community and take part of the public resources through our GitHub page: https://github.com/todogroup. TODO Community Members include, but are not restricted to:

* OSPO Managers
* OSPO initiatives
* Industry partners 
* Foundations

In order to keep a secure place to freely share sensitive information, the TODO Group offers TODO Member-only spaces. If you consider you meet [TODO Membership requirements](/join/), please complete the [membership application](/join).
