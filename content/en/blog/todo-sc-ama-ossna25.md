## Insights Shared and Community Questions

The panel opened the session, surfacing valuable trends, challenges, and practical approaches, including insights drawn from our current state of practice:

- OSPOs are diversifying: As of 2025, Open Source Program Offices are no longer monolithic; they're evolving into embedded, specialized units tailored to business domains such as AI, security, developer experience, and legal compliance
- Beyond responsible open source usage, OSPOs provide *governance as guidance*, enabling developers to safely adopt and contribute to open source while ensuring compliance and alignment with business goals
- Security is a central pillar: OSPOs play a critical role in software supply chain integrity for effective SBOM management. They’re developing workflows that integrate vulnerability management, license compliance, and upstream engagement
- Embedded OSPOs in AI/ML teams are emerging as *specialist arms*, focusing on model transparency, open datasets, and framework governance.

## Key Questions from the Community

The session also offer space to tackle questions from OSPO practitioners and curious newcomers, including:

- **How do you encourage company support** once you discover a project is widely used internally?
- **What financial responsibilities** do OSPOs have when it comes to supporting their open source dependencies?
- **Do engineers lead open source adoption**, or is it strategically aligned with company services?
- **How can someone join the TODO Group?** Is there a Slack? A mentorship program?
