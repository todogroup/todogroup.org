## Interested in joining the TODO Group as General Member?

[TODO Group Community](https://todogroup.org/community/) is open to all. Sometimes, there are community participants with an established OSPO or open source initiative who wish to become a General Member.

* Every TODO Group General Member must agree and sign the [charter](https://github.com/todogroup/charter).

* If you're interested in joining and support TODO as General Member, please complete the [membership application](https://enrollment.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/?project=todogroup).

*Note: To be a TODO Group General Member, you must be a [Linux Foundation member](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/members/join).*

Community participants coming from **entities focused on [OSPO-related topics](https://ospomindmap.todogroup.org/) who help OSPOs but may not have an OSPO** can support TODO by becoming [OSPO Associates](/associates).

*Note: OSPO Associate Program is different from TODO Group general membership and not entitled to general member benefits. To see OSPO Associate benefits, please [read the documentation](https://github.com/todogroup/governance/blob/main/OSPO-Associate-Program.md)*
