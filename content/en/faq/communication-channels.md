What are the main TODO communication channels and how can the OSPO Community get involved? The TODO Group currently support two work models:

### Public communication channels

* **Public meetings:** [Public meetings](https://community.linuxfoundation.org/todo-group/) are open to **everyone involved in the OSPO industry,** from TODO Members to external organizations, foundations or any other industry partners. The TODO Group currently hosts OSPOlogy as the general meeting, but we are expecting to add new working areas in the near future. Everyone is more than welcome to contribute to OSPOlogy planning, upcoming topics and guest proposals: https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/tree/main/meetings

* **Public TODO slack channel:** [TODO Slack](https://slack.todogroup.org/) channel is a great place to introduce yourself to the community and say hi!

* **OSPO Newsletters:** Stay up to date in Open Source Program Office (OSPO) trends: https://www.getrevue.co/profile/osponews

* **OSPO Discussions:** If you're interested in OSPO related discussions, you can post questions on the TODO Group Slack and also https://github.com/todogroup/ospology/discussions

### Private communication channels

* **Private meetings:** This space is meant for TODO members-only, to share OSPO knowledge in a private sensitive setting. If you are a TODO Member and would like to get involved in these meetings, please contact [info@todogroup.org](mailto://info@todogroup.org) specifying your membership info.

* **Private TODO Mailing list:** This space is meant for TODO members-only, to share OSPO knowledge in a private sensitive setting.
