## üöÄ Key Findings

![osposurvey](/img/blog/ospo-survey-insights-2022.png) 

### More Structured OSPOs

Adoption of OSPOs or similar programs has risen to 50%, the highest level in 5 years. Professionalization continues among OSPOs, as 60% of the programs are formally structured with dedicated person-hours,reporting structure and/or job titles structured, up from 54% two years ago.

### OSPO Benefits

* Software practices continue to see gains. Climbing to the highest level in the study‚Äôs history, 83% of
respondents said their organizations programs had a positive impact software practices.

* Open source is the life-blood for many of the small businesses represented in this study. OSPOs continue
to be seen as extremely or very critical to the success engineering or product teams. However, respondents at organizations with less than 50 employees are twice as likely to believe the efforts are extremely critical
as compared to those at organizations with 1,000 or more employees.

* Increased influence in open source communities rose several places to become #2 on the list of areas where
organizations have benefited most from OSPOs. Increased innovation fell to #4 but continues to be
the top benefit among organizations with less than 10 employees.

### Big Organizations Stand Apart

* OSPOs at organizations with more than 20,000 employees continue to stand apart. They represent 47% of all the formally structured OSPOs in the study.License compliance and general awareness and use of open source dependencies are the top ways they benefit from OSPOs.

### Organizations Without an Open SourceProgram or Initiative

* There is an opportunity to create new OSPOs in the Asia-Pacific region. Half of the participants without
plans for an OSPO think it would benefit their company.

### European Organizations

European-headquartered organizations are often not training, recruiting and hiring developers to work on
open source projects. For example, 44% of European organizations never recruit or hire developers to work
on open source projects vs the study average of 27%.

### Asia-Pacific Organizations

51% of respondents at Asia-Pacific organization believe an OSPO would be beneficial as compared to
35% of those based in North America. Recruiting and retaining developer talent is the top challenge Asia-
Pacific organizations face.

### Gauging Participation in Open Source Ecosystems

* Almost half of the organizations that have an open source program/initiative (46%), regardless of its
formality, have reviewed or audited contracts as way to gauge participation in open source ecosystems.
That compares to 28% of everyone else.

* Along with contracts, open source disclosure documents supplied by third-party vendors can be
used to gauge ‚Äúcommunity citizenship‚Äù. However, 55% of the study did not know if their organization collects, verifies, grades and then publicly shares this information. Among those that could answer the question, publicly sharing the findings is even less common.
