This is the Q1 2025 review provided by the TODO Steering Committee (SC), sharing the progress made on the approved strategic goals for the year. 
These efforts reflect input from the 2024 end-of-year review, the TODO AMA session at LFMS 2024, and the 2024 OSPO Survey highlighting key trends 
and challenges in open source program management.

## What's New?

- 🎯 **2025 Strategic Goals Approved**

## Q1 Progress Highlights

- 📘 **Ambassador Guidelines Updated**  
  Revised and published with clearer onboarding and engagement recommendations.

  A structured agenda now invites members to:
  - Share past conference talks  
  - Introduce new tools/initiatives

- 🔄 **Steering Committee Update**  
  One of the SC members, **Nik Peters**, has stepped down from their role. We’re grateful for Nik’s contributions to TODO, including sharing Porsche’s OSPO journey in the OSPO Book and participating in the TODO 10th Anniversary video.  
  Following the results of the last SC elections, **Alice Sowerby** will fill the vacant seat through December 2025. Alice is one of the OSPO Book chairs, a highly active TODO contributor, and contributor to the CHAOSS podcast.  
  **Welcome, Alice!**

- 🔐 **Closer Connection with OpenSSF**  
  TODO participated in **OSPOlogyLive Amsterdam**, sharing open source management guidance for security teams.  
  A full **Security Chapter** (Chapter 5) has been featured in the OSPO Book as a result of this collaboration.

- 🎓 **Stronger Ties with Academia**  
  TODO is advancing conversations on **industry–academic OSPO collaboration**, particularly through its connection with the **CURIOSS** community.
