Universities can join the TODO Group to collaborate on practices, tools, and other ways to run successful and effective open source programs and open source initatives, as well as to engage in discussions with OSPO professionals.

OSPO professionals from universities such as [Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT)](https://www.rit.edu/research/open) or [University of California Santa Cruz](https://cross.ucsc.edu) have been TODO Members over the past years.

Please, take a look to the [TODO Group Overview Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1p4dhx0Dg8fZDO8yzp7nWC2r5WHyVH-jjSQM59lkKLdo/edit?usp=sharing) to learn more about membership benefits.
