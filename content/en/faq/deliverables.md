Our plans include work such as:

* Sharing best practices for running large open source programs well
* Codifying criteria or qualities that well-run projects should aspire to
* Tooling & instrumentation that makes it easier to reach and maintain those standards
* A directory of projects and initiatives from the community that meet some or all of those criteria

TODO resources are open to everyone and available at [TODO Group GitHub repo](https://github.com/todogroup) under `CC-BY 4.0 Licence`. We encourage people to share their knowledge and help growing this community by adding their contributions to the different TODO initiatives such as:
