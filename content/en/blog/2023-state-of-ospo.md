The annual OSPO study examines the prevalence and outcomes of Open Source Progam Offices and similar OSS Initiatives across sectors, 
including the key benefits, value provided, and challenges ahead.

## OSPOs Become Mainstream

In 2023, the adoption of OSPO and OSS initiatives witnessed a 32% increase compared to 2022. The key findings cover a broad range 
of topics, from how OSPOs are addressing security concerns and supporting open source sustainability, to enhancing software best 
practices within organizations.
