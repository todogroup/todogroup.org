## About TODO

The Linux Foundation's TODO Group supports organizations in establishing and fostering strategic and sustainable open source engagements by addressing common challenges and openly sharing best practices for successful implementation.

General Members of the TODO Group are representatives from organizations actively engaged in open source management and strategy. They are responsible for driving open source adoption across divisions and product lines. A proven pattern to enable this adoption is the establishment of Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs). 
By joining TODO, your organization can contribute to the growth and continuous update of best practices, ensuring more organizations can successfully engage with open source.
